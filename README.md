## Problem statement

Atliq Grands  HR manager wants to understand the working preferences of employees with respect to their attendance. Specifically, she is interested in the following:

Understanding the frequency of employees choosing to work from home.
Identifying if there are specific days (like Mondays or Fridays) when employees prefer to work from home.
Exploring any patterns or reasons behind these preferences.
The data available for this analysis includes employee IDs, attendance codes (like ‘WFH’ for Work From Home), and the dates. The goal is to use this data to build a Power BI dashboard that can provide the desired insights. This will help the HR manager make informed decisions and strategies related to employee attendance and work preferences.

## Learnt things from this Project 
From a technical perspective, this project involves several key learnings:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: You'll learn how to import data from an Excel file into Power BI. This includes handling different data types and dealing with missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Data Transformation**: Power BI's Query Editor allows you to transform your data before analysis. This could involve merging columns, changing data types, or creating new calculated columns.

3. **DAX Functions**: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula language used in Power BI. You'll learn how to create new measures using DAX functions, which can be used in your visualizations.

4. **Visualizations**: Power BI offers a wide range of visualization options. You'll learn how to choose the right visualizations for your data and how to customize them to meet your needs.

5. **Dashboard Design**: You'll learn how to arrange your visualizations into a dashboard, providing a cohesive and interactive view of your data.

6. **Data Modeling**: Understanding how to create relationships between different tables in your data model is a crucial part of working with Power BI.

7. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Power BI allows you to share your dashboards with others. You'll learn how to publish your dashboard to the Power BI service, where you can create a shareable link or collaborate with others in your organization.


## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

Presence Percentage Trends:

The presence percentage is declining, particularly as the month of June approaches.
The increase in remote work is contributing to the decline in overall presence.
Seasonal Influence on Sick Leaves:

Sick leaves show a slight increase, possibly attributed to the hot summer months.
Understanding the seasonal variations in sick leaves can help in planning for resource availability.
Capacity Planning for Software Releases:

Acknowledging the lower capacity during June, especially with more people working from home.
Suggests planning software releases around June to align with the team's capacity.
Insights from Day-wise Analysis:

People tend to be present the most on Tuesdays, making it an ideal day for important activities.
Fridays see the highest instances of employees working from home, possibly due to combining with weekends for longer breaks.
Strategic Team Activities:

Considering team-building activities or important events on Mondays when presence is generally higher.
Automated Notification System:

Discussing the implementation of an automated notification system based on attendance thresholds.
The system could send emails if the presence percentage falls below a specified limit, ensuring timely awareness.
Future Considerations for Remote Work:

Evaluating the potential for making Fridays a universal work-from-home day.
Exploring resource optimization strategies, such as infrastructure maintenance on Fridays.
Data Automation for Dashboard Updates:

Proposing the use of cloud platforms like SharePoint to automate data updates.
Simplifying the process for HR by reducing manual handling of attendance data.
Access Control for Dashboard Users:

Discussing the implementation of visual-level privileges to control access for different user groups.
Creating separate dashboards for managers and employees, ensuring data confidentiality.
Strategic Resource Utilization:

Exploring options for optimized resource utilization in a hybrid work model.
Suggesting rotational schedules for employees to ensure office capacity is effectively managed.
